HighPay: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) v1.0 
PlanCore Philosophy: The Pain-Free ExperienceThe primary goal of the HighPay MVP is to deliver on our core promise: a simple, fast, and
intuitive payroll experience. We will relentlessly focus on the essential workflows that cause the most pain for businesses and employees, executing them with flawless
simplicity. The beauty of v1.0 is not in having every feature, but in perfecting the features we have.

Pillar I: The Admin Dashboard (MVP)The essential command center for the business owner or HR manager.
1. Simplified Onboarding:A clean sign-up flow for a "Head Management" user to create their company account.A simple workflow to add employees
manually with core details (name, email, pay rate).
2. Core Payroll Workflow:A streamlined "Run Payroll" process that focuses on verifying hours and confirming totals.Basic
calculation of wages and standard deductions.A clear, final approval step.
3. Essential Employee Management:A searchable list of all employees.The ability to view and edit core
employee details (the features we built).
4. Basic Reporting:The ability to view payroll history.A downloadable PDF of a simple Payroll Summary for each run.

Pillar II: The Employee Mobile App (MVP)The fast, no-nonsense tool for the employee.
1. Home Screen:The intuitive layout we designed: at-a-glance status, clear clock-in/out button.
2. 2. Core Time
Tracking:Functional Clock In/Out: The large, central button is the primary interaction.Activity Log: A simple, running list of the day's punches (Clock In, Start Lunch, End
Lunch, Clock Out).Compliance Timer: The passive, background timer that triggers the "Meal Break Required" notification after a set number of hours worked. It is a reminder, not
a blocker.
3. Pay Stub Access:A "Pay" tab that allows employees to view and download PDF versions of their past pay stubs.Pillar III: Real-Time Push Notifications (MVP)This is
the "intelligent" layer that makes the app feel proactive and modern.
For Managers / Admins:Missed Clock-In: "David Chen was scheduled for 9:00 AM but has not clocked in." (with
one-tap contact info).Time-Off Request: "Eleanor Vance has requested time off."For Employees:Meal Break Reminder: "You've been working for 5 hours. A meal break is
required."Payday Notification: "You've been paid! Your new pay stub is available."What's NOT in the MVP?To maintain focus, the following features from our master plan will be
targeted for post-launch releases:Advanced AI: The AI Daily Briefing, AI Report Builder, and Onboarding Plan Generator.Complex Integrations: No direct integrations with
QuickBooks, Xero, etc. in v1.0. We will focus on providing clear CSV exports.Deep Settings: No granular role permission editor, advanced branding, or complex security
configurations.Detailed Scheduling: The full schedule builder and importer. The mobile app will simply show basic shift times set by the admin.This lean MVP delivers massive
value by solving the most critical problems first. It allows us to launch, get user feedback, and build momentum toward our grander vision.
